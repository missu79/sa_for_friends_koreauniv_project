160,21,5,Monica,"Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets."
161,21,6,Richard,Why?

173,23,2,Ross,"I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash."
174,23,3,Ross,So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge!

205,27,6,Joey,"How is ""Monica, I love your sweet ass,"" inappropriate?"
206,27,7,Ross,How?s Monica coming along with her vows?
207,27,8,Phoebe,"Well let?s just say its.. she?s lucky she has a sweet ass, ?cause she?s not so good at the writing."

209,28,1,Young Ethan,"I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen."
210,28,2,Monica,How was that possible?
211,28,3,Mrs. Geller,"Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy."
212,28,4,Monica,"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?"
213,28,5,Monica,Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.

238,32,5,Chandler,Oh no-no-no!
239,32,6,Doug,"Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y?know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head."

247,34,2,Monica,"Alright, what?s going on?"
248,34,3,Monica,I?m sorry. I?m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.

298,41,4,Rachel,"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
299,41,5,Dr. Franzblau,"No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do."
300,41,6,Rachel,Oh.
301,41,7,Dr. Franzblau,"I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do."

317,44,0,Ross,"Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore."
318,44,1,Rachel,You think?!
319,44,2,Ross,"All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again."
320,44,3,Chandler,"Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now."
321,44,4,Ross,I can't believe that didn't work!
322,44,5,Rachel,"I know, me neither! I mean, you"
323,44,6,Chandler,"Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?"
324,45,0,Bitter lady,"Well, I bet you are all thinkin' ""Now would be a really    great time for an intermission"", huh?"
325,45,1,Chandler,"oh yes, God yes!!"
326,45,2,Bitter lady,"Well, you're not gonna get one!"
327,45,3,Bitter lady,"Because in    life there are no intermissions, people."
328,45,4,Bitter lady,Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word.
329,45,5,Chandler,I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
330,46,0,Ross,Grab a spoon.
331,46,1,Ross,Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon?
332,46,2,Ross,"Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?"
333,46,3,Joey,"Great story!? But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...? Oh man,"
334,46,4,Chandler,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats."
335,46,5,Joey,Right.? Thanks.? It's June.? I'm outta here.
336,46,6,Ross,"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?"
337,47,0,Ross,"Okay, and oh I?m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all."
338,47,1,Mona,"Hey Ross, what?s going on? You changing the lock?"
339,47,2,Ross,No. That guy is.
340,47,3,Mona,I don?t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.
341,47,4,Mona,"Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you?re-you?re sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?"
342,47,5,Ross,I?m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
343,47,6,Mona,What?
344,47,7,Ross,I love you!
345,47,8,Mona,Ohh!  And I love spending time with you.
346,48,0,Ross,I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
347,48,1,Chandler,"Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?"
348,48,2,Joey,"He's right, enough, already."
349,48,3,Joey,What is the big deal about today?
350,48,4,Joey,"So you slept with her for the first time, so what?"
351,48,5,Joey,You slept with her for seven years after that.
352,48,6,Ross,"Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
353,49,0,Joey,How can you say that?! The
354,49,1,Erin,What about Benitez?
355,49,2,Joey,What about Game 1 of the Series?
356,49,3,Erin,What about shut up?
357,49,4,Ross,That was you?
358,49,5,Ross,"Oh I, I don?t-I don?t think that would be the best idea."
359,49,6,Ross,What time?
360,49,7,Ross,Gotcha.
361,49,8,Ross,"Oh! So-so seriously, what time?"
362,50,0,Rachel,Hey Pheebs.
363,50,1,Phoebe,Hey!
364,50,2,Rachel,Any sign of your brother?
365,50,3,Phoebe,"No, but he?s always late."
366,50,4,Rachel,I thought you only met him once?
367,50,5,Phoebe,"Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ?Frank?s always late.?"
368,50,6,Rachel,"Well relax, he?ll be here."
369,50,7,Phoebe,"No, I know, I?m just nervous."
370,50,8,Phoebe,"Y'know it?s just y'know Mom?s dead, don?t talk to my sister, Grandma?s been sleeping a lot lately."
371,50,9,Phoebe,"It?s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing."
372,50,10,Phoebe,You?re so sweet to wait with me.
373,50,11,Rachel,"Well, actually Gunther sent me. You?re not allowed to have cups out here, it?s a thing."
374,51,0,Ross,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you."
375,51,1,Ross,"You know, that's the    kind of guy Joey is."
376,51,2,Charlie,He is very sweet. Plus he's
377,51,3,Ross,That was going to be my next argument.
378,51,4,Joey,Hey!
379,51,5,Ross,Hey!
380,51,6,Charlie,Hey!
381,51,7,Joey,You're ready?
382,51,8,Charlie,"Yeah, let's go.   Thanks    Ross."
383,51,9,Joey,"Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up."
384,51,10,Ross,Glad I could help man.
385,51,11,Joey,"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but...  I made it work."
386,52,0,Phoebe,Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
387,52,1,Rachel,I know.
388,52,2,Phoebe,"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
389,52,3,Rachel,"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I?m gonna tell him no."
390,52,4,Phoebe,Huh.
391,52,5,Rachel,I mean I think I?d say no to anybody right now.
392,52,6,Rachel,"Oh, but it was so strange."
393,52,7,Rachel,"I mean I?m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who?s asking me to go out with him, which I?m allowed to do, and I felt guilty."
394,52,8,Rachel,"Y'know, like I?d be cheating on Ross or something."
395,52,9,Phoebe,"Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you?re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father."
396,52,10,Rachel,I don?t have any issues with my Father.
397,52,11,Phoebe,"Okay, so it?s probably just the Ross thing then."
398,53,0,Chandler,I don?t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.  Draw!!
399,53,1,Chandler,"I wasn?t doing anything.  Uh-oh, what did she do now?"
400,53,2,Joey,"Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she?s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"
401,53,3,Chandler,"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
402,53,4,Joey,"God, I just, I hate her!"
403,53,5,Joey,I hate her!!
404,53,6,Joey,"With her, ?Oh, I?m so talented.? and ?Oh, I?m so pretty,? and ?Ooh, I smell so good.?"
405,53,7,Chandler,I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
406,53,8,Joey,"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"
407,53,9,Chandler,"I?m talking about you. You big, big freak."
408,53,10,Joey,"Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, you?re out of your mind."
409,53,11,Chandler,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours!"
410,53,12,Chandler,If you were in a school yard you?d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
411,53,13,Joey,"Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!"
412,54,0,Chandler,...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
413,54,1,Joey,Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
414,54,2,Chandler,We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
415,54,3,Ross,Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know.
416,54,4,Ross,"Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry."
417,54,5,Ross,Sorry.
418,54,6,Rachel,I'm a waitress.
419,54,7,Dr. Franzblau,"Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'..."
420,54,8,Rachel,Yeah. Gotcha.
421,54,9,Dr. Franzblau,I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
422,54,10,Rachel,Ok. That's fine.
423,55,0,Chandler,"Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?"
424,55,1,Joey,Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
425,55,2,Chandler,I?m here to see Mary-Angela.
426,55,3,Joey,You are so the man!
427,55,4,Joey,"Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ?cause my Grandma doesn?t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off."
428,55,5,Joey,She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.
429,55,6,Joey,Yeah.
430,55,7,Chandler,Where?s Mary-Angela?
431,55,8,Joey,She?s right in there.
432,55,9,Joey,Morning.
433,55,10,Chandler,Actually he?s the smallest person in the world.
434,55,11,Joey,Heard about the leg burnin? huh?
435,55,12,Chandler,It came up.
436,55,13,Joey,"Listen, I ah, I know it?s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?"
437,56,0,Chandler,Airplane
438,56,1,Rachel,"Oh, time's up."
439,56,2,Monica,Bye... bye...
440,56,3,Monica,What's a 'niffle'?
441,56,4,Joey,You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
442,56,5,Rachel,"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
443,56,6,Ross,"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'?"
444,56,7,Ross,"Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
445,56,8,Rachel,"Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!"
446,56,9,All,Nooo!
447,57,0,Monica,"Ok, I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of the  signs you bought are good."
448,57,1,Phoebe,"No they ran out of ""It’s a girl"" but I can fix this one,  See?"
449,57,2,Monica,So  sexy.  Honey.
450,57,3,Chandler,Yea yea.
451,57,4,Monica,Honey why don’t you go lie down.
452,57,5,Chandler,"No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta  go to the office  Am I producing  them?"
453,57,6,Joey,Why’re you so tired?
454,57,7,Chandler,"Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying  about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried  about it the more I couldn’t sleep."
455,57,8,Chandler,Y’know?
456,57,9,Chandler,"I was like, if I fall asleep  now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours  sleep."
457,57,10,Chandler,Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.
458,57,11,Joey,"You know what you should’ve done, you should have told yourself  that little story."
459,57,12,Rachel,Hi!
460,57,13,Everyone,"Hi, welcome home!"
461,58,0,Susan,"Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?"
462,58,1,Ross,Helen Geller? I don't think so.
463,58,2,Carol,Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
464,58,3,Ross,Thank you!
465,58,4,Fake Monica,"Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the"
466,58,5,Monica,"Well, not... worried, just... wondering."
467,58,6,Fake Monica,"There's nothing to wonder about, Monica."
468,58,7,Fake Monica,"You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are."
469,58,8,Monica,Not necessarily...
470,58,9,Fake Monica,"Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing."
471,58,10,Monica,"Um, I'm not actually Amish."
472,58,11,Fake Monica,Really? Then why are you like that?
473,59,0,Phoebe,I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed!
474,59,1,Phoebe,Y'know that old guy that lives next to me?
475,59,2,Phoebe,"Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop."
476,59,3,Phoebe,But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies.
477,59,4,Phoebe,Then I felt wonderful.
478,59,5,Phoebe,That old jackass!
479,59,6,Rachel,Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
480,59,7,Chandler,"I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!"
481,59,8,Monica,You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
482,59,9,Ross,"Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings."
483,59,10,Monica,But the minute we start to lie to each other?  And by 'we' I mean society.
484,60,0,Ross,"There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?"
485,60,1,Rachel,Sure.
486,60,2,Ross,Yep?
487,60,3,Rachel,"Sure, I?ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing."
488,60,4,Ross,"Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?"
489,60,5,Rachel,"Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?"
490,60,6,Ross,"Sure, okay."
491,60,7,Rachel,"Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around."
492,60,8,Ross,What?
493,60,9,Rachel,I don?t want you to see me naked!
494,60,10,Ross,"Rachel, I?ve seen you naked a million times."
495,60,11,Ross,I ate hot fudge off you naked.
496,60,12,Ross,"Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?"
497,60,13,Phoebe,Nah-ha!
498,61,0,Joey,Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
499,61,1,Chandler,"Oh, I wish I?d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese."
500,61,2,Joey,Oh that?s okay.
501,61,3,Joey,"Hey, actually in a way it?s kinda nice."
502,61,4,Joey,"Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!"
503,61,5,Chandler,"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night."
504,61,6,Chandler,"What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?"
505,61,7,Joey,"What, are you crazy?"
506,61,8,Joey,You haven?t beaten me once since my injury plagued ?97 season.
507,61,9,Joey,It would be easier if you just give me your money.
508,61,10,Chandler,Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
509,61,11,Joey,"Okay, you?re on."
510,61,12,Chandler,"Okay, let?s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently."
511,62,0,Chandler,"It?s not a big deal. It?s, just it?s right here,  and it?s all the time."
512,62,1,Joanna,"Well, thanks again for lunch."
513,62,2,Chandler,"Yes, this, this was pleasant."
514,62,3,Monica,"No honey, I?m sorry, but the weekend?s not over yet."
515,62,4,Rachel,"Oh.  Oh my God, is that Phoebe?"
516,62,5,Monica,I guess they?re back from their date.
517,62,6,Rachel,Music. Very nice.
518,62,7,Monica,Oh my God!
519,62,8,Rachel,"So, how are you?"
520,62,9,Monica,I am good. I finished my book.
521,62,10,Rachel,"Oh yeah, what?s it about?"
522,62,11,Monica,I don?t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
523,62,12,Rachel,"Yeah, I do."
524,63,0,Joey,"Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period."
525,63,1,Smart Kid,Isn?t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
526,63,2,Joey,Shhh!
527,63,3,Joey,"This is a museum, no talking."
528,63,4,Joey,"Right down here,  we have a large foot."
529,63,5,Joey,"Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller."
530,63,6,Joey,Everyone wave ?Hi? to Ross.
531,63,7,Joey,"Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work."
532,63,8,Joey,"Okay, moving right along."
533,63,9,Joey,Come on.
534,64,0,Chandler,I can't believe it! We're here!
535,64,1,Monica,"Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!"
536,64,2,Chandler,"Oh, you should live with Joey,"
537,64,3,Monica,"Come here.  Okay, be right back."
538,64,4,Chandler,"Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!"
539,64,5,Monica,We're switching rooms.
540,64,6,Chandler,"Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!"
541,64,7,Monica,"No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them!"
542,64,8,Monica,"I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change."
543,64,9,Monica,"Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?"
544,65,0,Rachel,Okay! I?m ready.
545,65,1,Ross,You sure?
546,65,2,Rachel,"Yes, I?ve done my studying and I really know my stuff."
547,65,3,Ross,All right then.  Rachel Green! Let?s play Bamboozled!  How do you test the temperature of the baby?s bath water?
548,65,4,Rachel,"Uh, put your elbow in it."
549,65,5,Ross,Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
550,65,6,Rachel,"Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers."
551,65,7,Ross,"That?s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?"
552,65,8,Rachel,"Check if it?s wet, check if it?s hungry, burp it!"
553,65,9,Ross,"Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?"
554,65,10,Rachel,A card! A card! I pick a card!
555,65,11,Ross,"Oh, I?m sorry you?ve been Bamboozled! You?re gonna be a terrible mother!  I?ve lost sight of why we?re doing this!"
556,66,0,Ross,she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I?m not with Rachel.
557,66,1,Phoebe,Yeah.  Why aren?t you with Rachel?
558,66,2,Ross,"Are you kidding? Look, we?re not gonna be together just because we?re having a baby. Okay?"
559,66,3,Phoebe,But y?know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
560,66,4,Ross,"Okay, stop it! I can?t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby."
561,66,5,Phoebe,Right. And with who again?
562,66,6,Joey,God. He?s crazy! Why doesn?t he want to be with Rachel?
563,66,7,Phoebe,I know!
564,66,8,Joey,"I mean seriously, she?s like the perfect woman."
565,66,9,Joey,"I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn?t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and?  I haven?t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?"
566,67,0,Joey,"Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it     Thanks for coming."
567,67,1,Monica,Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
568,67,2,Kyle Lowder,Hi.
569,67,3,Monica,I love you!
570,67,4,Joey,"Hey, that's why I didn't invite you."
571,67,5,Joey,"you have to calm down, alright...    go, go get yourself a drink or something..."
572,67,6,Monica,Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
573,67,7,Phoebe,Hey!
574,67,8,Monica,"Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all    this? I can barely control myself."
575,67,9,Phoebe,"Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where"
576,67,10,Monica,Oh my God! Chandler!
577,68,0,Joey,Oh yeah.
578,68,1,Rachel,Ahhhh?.
579,68,2,Joey,Ahhh??  Eh?
580,68,3,Rachel,Uh-huh.
581,68,4,Monica,Hey guys!
582,68,5,Rachel,Hey!
583,68,6,Joey,Hey!
584,68,7,Monica,Do you guys know what happened to Chandler?s barcalounger?
585,68,8,Rachel,"Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it."
586,68,9,Monica,Are you kidding?! I get a
587,69,0,Monica,Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
588,69,1,Joey,Yep.
589,69,2,Monica,Which?
590,69,3,Monica,What is the big deal?
591,69,4,Chandler,It's weird! In a doctor's office?
592,69,5,Monica,It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
593,69,6,Chandler,"I cannot believe Ross told you that!     And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"
594,69,7,Monica,"Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think    it's a good idea!"
595,69,8,Chandler,"Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!"
596,69,9,Monica,OH!
597,69,10,Chandler,"Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!"
598,70,0,Joey,I hate this woman!!
599,70,1,Joey,I hate her!
600,70,2,Joey,"She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks."
601,70,3,Joey,"Okay, and whenever I can?t do it, they?re all like-like laughing at me."
602,70,4,Ross,Hello.
603,70,5,Chandler and Joey,Hey!
604,70,6,Ross,So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
605,70,7,Joey,"Wow, what-what do you think she wants?"
606,70,8,Ross,"Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks."
607,70,9,Chandler,"It?s possible. You are very loveable, I?d miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive."
608,70,10,Ross,Then be supportive like a guy.
609,70,11,Chandler,"If I broke up with you, I?d miss you."
610,71,0,Monica,"Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now."
611,71,1,Phoebe,"Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely."
612,71,2,Monica,Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
613,71,3,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay."
614,71,4,Monica,"Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Oooh, I can't leave her!"
615,71,5,Phoebe,"You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know."
616,71,6,Monica,That's not gonna work.
617,71,7,Phoebe,I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
618,71,8,Monica,Hey! I didn't know either.
619,71,9,Phoebe,"Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?"
620,71,10,Monica,"Yeah, I knew."
621,72,0,Monica,"Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey."
622,72,1,Phoebe,"Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!"
623,72,2,Monica,"Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont."
624,72,3,Chandler,I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.
625,72,4,Chandler,Do you want people to think it's a fake conference?
626,72,5,Chandler,It's a real conference.
627,72,6,Ross,Hey.
628,72,7,Joey,Hey!
629,72,8,Monica,Hey.
630,72,9,Ross,Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
631,72,10,Monica,"No, she's out shopping."
632,73,0,Chandler,"Shhhhhhhhh!!!  I?m sorry, I thought maybe I?d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep."
633,73,1,Monica,With a wok?  I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
634,73,2,Chandler,It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
635,73,3,Monica,"Here, let me make the milk, I?m up anyway."
636,73,4,Chandler,"Hey, y?know what we can do?"
637,73,5,Chandler,"Y?know, now that we are up?"
638,73,6,Chandler,"We can just like talk to each other all night long, y?know like we did when we were first going out."
639,73,7,Chandler,It?d be fun!
640,73,8,Monica,Okay that does sound like fun.
641,73,9,Chandler,"Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?"
642,73,10,Monica,The second sister dies?!
643,73,11,Chandler,"No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading."
644,73,12,Monica,The second sister dies in
645,73,13,Chandler,That?s correct.
646,74,0,Ross,Look at it this way:
647,74,1,All,Hey!
648,74,2,Joey,You're a lucky man.
649,74,3,Joey,You know what I miss the most about her?
650,74,4,Joey,That cute nibbly noise when she eats.
651,74,5,Joey,"Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
652,74,6,Bob,"Huh, I never really noticed."
653,74,7,Joey,"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
654,74,8,Bob,"Monica, Monica is great."
655,74,9,Joey,"Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
656,75,0,Chandler,You're shooting with Althea?!
657,75,1,Ross,Althea is correct.
658,75,2,Chandler,Nice shooting!
659,75,3,Rachel,We?ll take Literature!!
660,75,4,Ross,"Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey?s apartment. What name appears on the address label?"
661,75,5,Rachel,Chandler gets it! It?s Chandler Bing!
662,75,6,Monica,No!!
663,75,7,Ross,I?m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
664,75,8,Monica,I knew that! Rachel! Use you?re head!
665,75,9,Chandler,"Actually, it?s Miss Chinandolor Bong."
666,76,0,Monica,Phoebe did the signs!
667,76,1,Rachel,Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
668,76,2,Phoebe,Look at all the stuff people sent!
669,76,3,Rachel,Oh Ah!

671,76,5,Rachel,What are people think…  Oh you guys I love it.
672,76,6,Joey,Hey so where’s Ross?
673,76,7,Rachel,He’s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the  cab.
674,76,8,Joey,Is he still mad at us?
675,76,9,Rachel,"Well, you more then me, but he can’t stay to mad at me. I  mean, I just had his baby."
676,76,10,Joey,That’s not fair! I can’t do that.
677,76,11,Rachel,"Yeah, I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up."
678,76,12,Joey,"See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be  here either but somebody  said he’d be over it by now."
679,76,13,Chandler,"Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla."
680,77,0,Rachel,I cannot believe that you didn?t tell me that we are still married!!
681,77,1,Ross,Look I was going to tell you!
682,77,2,Rachel,When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn?t get the annulment; we are still married.
683,77,3,Chandler,What?
684,77,4,Monica,You?re kidding!
685,77,5,Phoebe,Oh my God!!
686,77,6,Monica,Ross!
687,77,7,Ross,"Okay, maybe it wasn?t my best decision. But I just couldn?t face another failed marriage."
688,77,8,Chandler,"Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?"
689,77,9,Ross,"Rach, come on, if you think about it, it?s actually kinda funny.  Okay, maybe it?s best not to think about it."
690,77,10,Phoebe,"Okay,"
691,77,11,Ross,"Phoebe, I told her you already knew."
692,77,12,Phoebe,Another lie. You have a sickness!
693,77,13,Chandler,"Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you?re not married to anymore of us are ya?"
694,78,0,Joshua,"So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?"
695,78,1,Rachel,Um-hmm.  There we go. There it is.
696,78,2,Rachel,Oh yeah? Fine.
697,78,3,Ross,"Hey, y?know, y?know what would make me really happy?"
698,78,4,Rachel,"Oh yeah, no, what?s that?"
699,78,5,Ross,"If like the four of us could all y?know, hang out together."
700,78,6,Ross,"Uh, in fact Emily?s coming into town this weekend, why don?t you say we all have dinner?"
701,78,7,Ross,"Say, Sunday night?"
702,78,8,Rachel,That would be great!
703,78,9,Ross,"Yeah, all right, it?s a date."
704,78,10,Rachel,Hang in there. You hang in there.
705,78,11,Ross,Did you say something?
706,78,12,Rachel,"No, just singing."
707,79,0,Casting Director #1,Whenever you?re ready.
708,79,1,Joey,"Okay. ""Hey, Timmy, I?ve got a surprise for you."""
709,79,2,Casting Director #1,"Hold it. I?m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less?intense?"
710,79,3,Chandler,"Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay."
711,79,4,Ross,"Umm, jealous!"
712,79,5,Gary,"Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here."
713,79,6,Ross,"Yeah, no problem."
714,79,7,Gary,Ross!
715,79,8,Ross,"Sorry! Sorry! Oh,  there!  Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!"
716,79,9,Chandler,Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
717,79,10,Joey,"Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?"
718,80,0,Monica,"Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles"
719,80,1,Phoebe,"Ooh,"
720,80,2,Chandler,Condoms?
721,80,3,Joey,You don't know how long we're gonna be in here!
722,80,4,Chandler,And condoms are the way to do that?
723,80,5,Ross,"Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily"
724,80,6,Rachel,Oh my God! My dog died!
725,80,7,Ross,What?!
726,80,8,Rachel,"Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!"
727,80,9,Ross,Le Poo's still alive?!
728,80,10,Rachel,"Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh.  Oh my God."
729,80,11,Monica,"Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry."
730,80,12,Rachel,It's Le Poo.
731,80,13,Phoebe,"I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better."
732,81,0,Ross,So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
733,81,1,Monica,"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
734,81,2,Chandler,Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
735,81,3,Monica,Yeah.
736,81,4,Joey,You know more than one Fun Bobby?
737,81,5,Chandler,I happen to know a Fun Bob.
738,81,6,Rachel,"Okay, here we go..."
739,81,7,Joey,"Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
740,81,8,Rachel,There. Now there is.
741,81,9,Carol,All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
742,81,10,Carol,Not her.
743,82,0,Phoebe,Hey!
744,82,1,Monica,Hey!
745,82,2,Phoebe,"So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?"
746,82,3,Monica,Crematorium Chris? Sure!
747,82,4,Phoebe,"He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies."
748,82,5,Rachel,"Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!"
749,82,6,Monica,"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated."
750,82,7,Rachel,What?
751,82,8,Rachel,"Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature!"
752,82,9,Rachel,"Not nature,"
753,82,10,Phoebe,"This is fashion?!  Okay, so to you,"
754,83,0,Chandler,I?m sorry you?re here with me instead of Roger.
755,83,1,Monica,"Yeah, me too."
756,83,2,Chandler,"Well, I could make it seem like he?s here."
757,83,3,Chandler,"""Here?s some little known facts about cous-cous."
758,83,4,Chandler,"They didn?t add the second cous until 1979."""
759,83,5,Monica,Stop it!! That?s not funny!!
760,83,6,Chandler,Okay.
761,83,7,Chandler,At a fake game!!
762,83,8,Ross,"Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I?d be glad to play you for it."
763,83,9,Ross,"But I should warn you, I am"
764,83,10,Chandler,Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
765,83,11,Ross,No.
766,83,12,Chandler,"Hmm, let?s see if it comes up this time."
767,84,0,Ross,Electrifying.  Emphatic time-time-time
768,84,1,Monica,"Y'know, there?s a"
769,84,2,Phoebe,It?s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
770,84,3,Ross,Thank you guys-guys-guys
771,84,4,Monica,"Hey, aren?t you up next?"
772,84,5,Phoebe,"Oh no, I?m not playing tonight."
773,84,6,Rachel,Why not?
774,84,7,Phoebe,I can?t follow Ross! It?d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed
775,84,8,Monica,"Phoebe, Ross sucks!"
776,84,9,Rachel,"Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him."
777,84,10,Phoebe,"Oh my God, he?s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!"
778,84,11,Monica,"Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too."
779,84,12,Rachel,"Yeah, Phoebe you?re? awful!"
780,84,13,Phoebe,You guys. You suck too.
781,85,0,Larry,You look beautiful this evening.
782,85,1,Phoebe,Show me the badge again.
783,85,2,Phoebe,Shiny.
784,85,3,Larry,"Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies  have been."
785,85,4,Phoebe,You are just nonstop!
786,85,5,Larry,We're outta here!
787,85,6,Phoebe,Why?!
788,85,7,Larry,Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
789,85,8,Phoebe,You have the power to do that?
790,85,9,Larry,This does.
791,85,10,Phoebe,Shut it down.
792,86,0,Rachel,"Okay, I need a, I need a drink!"
793,86,1,Ross,"Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff."
794,86,2,Ross,But who cares?!
795,86,3,Ross,Because it's all on me!
796,86,4,Ross,"That is, one big drink!"
797,86,5,Rachel,Macadamia nut?
798,86,6,Ross,Umm? Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
799,86,7,Rachel,Hm-mmm!
800,86,8,Ross,"Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?"
801,86,9,Rachel,Nope!
802,87,0,Rachel,"Joey, Joey I am so sorry."
803,87,1,Joey,I told you not to move it!
804,87,2,Joey,"Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move your mom, and you said don?t, and I did it anyway and her"
805,87,3,Rachel,"Okay, come on?Joey, I?ll buy you a new one!"
806,87,4,Rachel,All right?
807,87,5,Rachel,We?ll go down to the store right now and we?ll-we?ll get you a new chair.
808,87,6,Joey,She?s not even cold yet!
809,87,7,Rachel,"But don?t you think Rosita would?ve wanted you to move on? I mean y?know, she did always put?your comfort first."
810,87,8,Joey,That?s true.
811,87,9,Rachel,Okay? You ready?
812,87,10,Joey,"Yeah, I?  I don?t want Stevie to see her like this."
813,88,0,Phoebe,"Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?"
814,88,1,Rachel,Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
815,88,2,Mr. Heckles,"Er, yeah, it's mine."
816,88,3,Phoebe,He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
817,88,4,Mr. Heckles,"Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat."
818,88,5,Phoebe,Wait a minute. What's his name?

821,88,8,Mr. Heckles,"Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons."
822,88,9,Phoebe,Oooh! You are a very bad man!
823,88,10,Mr. Heckles,You owe me a cat.
824,89,0,Rachel,"Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent!"
825,89,1,Rachel,"{It?s a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names."
826,89,2,Rachel,"Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.}"
827,89,3,Rachel,Congratulations.
828,89,4,Rachel,Mazel Tov!
829,89,5,Rachel,Hi!
830,89,6,Rachel,"Oh, great hat."
831,89,7,Rachel,"Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding."
832,89,8,Rachel,Can you do that?
833,89,9,The Rabbi,I don?t know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
834,89,10,Rachel,"Yeah! Yeah. They?re?they?re-they?re my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus."
835,90,0,Ross,Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
836,90,1,Joey,"Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk."
837,90,2,Chandler,"Yeah, we are so sorry."
838,90,3,Phoebe,You're kinda stepping on the song.
839,90,4,Joey,"Look, we were"
840,90,5,Monica,"Whatever you decide, whatever you do."
841,90,6,Phoebe,"Okay,"
842,90,7,Ross,"Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now."
843,90,8,Phoebe,Yes! Exactly! And that's why
844,90,9,Monica,Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
845,90,10,Ross,Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
846,90,11,Phoebe,"Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!"
847,91,0,Rachel,"Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel."
848,91,1,Ross,All right.
849,91,2,Ross,Y'know what?
850,91,3,Ross,We don?t have to go downstairs!
851,91,4,Ross,We can bring Vegas up to us!
852,91,5,Ross,"All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack."
853,91,6,Ross,Here we go.
854,91,7,Ross,13
855,91,8,Rachel,Hit me!
856,91,9,Ross,"Oohh, 23.  Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!"
857,91,10,Rachel,I bet 20.
858,91,11,Ross,You're right!
859,92,0,Monica,So we can be friends who sleep together.
860,92,1,Richard,"Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball."
861,92,2,Monica,"Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?"
862,92,3,Richard,Just your dad.  Although that?s actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister?s neighbour next Tuesday.
863,92,4,Monica,Oh.
864,92,5,Richard,You want me to cancel it?
865,92,6,Monica,No!  No!
866,92,7,Richard,Okay.
867,92,8,Monica,"?Cause if you do that means you?d be cancelling it for me, and we?re just friends."
868,92,9,Richard,Exactly.
869,93,0,Rachel,"Okay, here we go."
870,93,1,Rachel,"I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face."
871,93,2,Rachel,What?
872,93,3,Rachel,"Honey, what is it?"
873,93,4,Rachel,Did I get it wrong?
874,93,5,Rachel,Did I get the hair wrong?
875,93,6,Rachel,What?
876,93,7,Rachel,Did you just picture it differently?
877,93,8,Rachel,What?
878,93,9,Rachel,What?
879,93,10,Ross,"No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's"
880,93,11,Ross,"I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life."
881,94,0,Joey,"Oooh, what you got there?"
882,94,1,Phoebe,Pastrami.
883,94,2,Joey,"Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y?know what goes good with that?"
884,94,3,Phoebe,"Hm-mm, corn beef."
885,94,4,Joey,"Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that?s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?"
886,94,5,Phoebe,Okay.
887,94,6,Joey,Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
888,94,7,Phoebe,Six months.
889,94,8,Joey,"Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?"
890,94,9,Phoebe,Not if I get there first.
891,95,0,Monica,Hey! There you are!
892,95,1,Chandler,There I am!
893,95,2,Monica,Are you okay?
894,95,3,Chandler,"Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine."
895,95,4,Monica,What?!
896,95,5,Chandler,"Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!"
897,95,6,Monica,"Chandler, what were you thinking?"
898,95,7,Chandler,"I don?t know, but don?t worry, don?t worry, because I know how to take a picture now."
899,95,8,Chandler,"Okay, see?"
900,95,9,Chandler,"Look down , look down, look down"
901,95,10,Monica,Chandler?
902,95,11,Chandler,Yeah!
903,96,0,Phoebe,Ooh Monica!
904,96,1,Monica,Hi!
905,96,2,Phoebe,Oh my God! I had the
906,96,3,Monica,I?I have to fire him.
907,96,4,Phoebe,But why?!
908,96,5,Monica,"Because he?s terrible! Okay, he?s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!"
909,96,6,Phoebe,"Well maybe he was just nervous, y?know you can be very intimidating."
910,96,7,Phoebe,And besides I?ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
911,96,8,Monica,"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished."
912,96,9,Phoebe,"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?"
913,96,10,Monica,"All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!"
914,96,11,Phoebe,"That?s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too."
915,96,12,Monica,I paid to have this done.
916,96,13,Phoebe,Love it!
917,97,0,Chandler,OH MY GOD!!!
918,97,1,Joey,WHAT?!!
919,97,2,Chandler,Are you all right?!
920,97,3,Joey,Yeah...
921,97,4,Chandler,What happened?!!
922,97,5,Joey,"Awww, man! He promised he wouldn?t take the chairs!!"
923,97,6,Chandler,What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
924,97,7,Joey,"Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn?t think big enough to fit a grown man!"
925,97,8,Chandler,So?You got in
926,97,9,Joey,"I was tryin? to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I?m gonna do?"
927,97,10,Chandler,BEND OVER?!!!
928,98,0,Rachel,"Well, we?re a little early, the lecture doesn?t end for 15 minutes."
929,98,1,Monica,"Yeah, but y?know we could sneak in and watch."
930,98,2,Rachel,"Yeah, we could."
931,98,3,Rachel,Oh hey look!
932,98,4,Rachel,There?s some Kappa Kappa Deltas!
933,98,5,Rachel,I was a Kappa.
934,98,6,Rachel,Hey sisters!
935,98,7,Rachel,"Wow, we really are bitches."
936,98,8,Ross,Right!
937,98,9,Ross,So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery!
938,98,10,Ross,"What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary."
939,98,11,Ross,Imagine his consternation when? Oh bloody hell.
940,99,0,Chandler,Did she call?
941,99,1,Phoebe,"No, sorry."
942,99,2,Chandler,"All right, maybe I should call her."
943,99,3,Joey,"No! Forget her, man! You don?t need her, you don?t need that!"
944,99,4,Ross,"He?s right, what she did was unforgivable."
945,99,5,Chandler,"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"
946,99,6,Ross,How might you be wrong?
947,99,7,Chandler,"Well y'know, what if she didn?t actually sleep with the guy?"
948,99,8,Joey,"Dude, tell me she actually told you this."
949,99,9,Chandler,"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!"
950,99,10,Ross,That?s all you?re basing this on?
951,99,11,Chandler,"That?s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
952,99,12,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There?s a lot of theories that didn?t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry."
953,99,13,Chandler,Oh my God!!
954,100,0,Richard,"Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?"
955,100,1,Melissa,"Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?"
956,100,2,Phoebe,"Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon."
957,100,3,Melissa,What one?
958,100,4,Phoebe,"Yeah! Y?know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning."
959,100,5,Melissa,"Oh, isn?t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?"
960,100,6,Rachel,"Anyway, speaking of drinking too much."
961,100,7,Rachel,"I was uh, tellin? Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out."
962,100,8,Melissa,What?
963,100,9,Rachel,"Remember?! We?come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops"
964,100,10,Melissa,Yeah?
965,100,11,Rachel,we went back to the house and we got really silly and we?we made out.
966,100,12,Melissa,"Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you?re talking about."
967,100,13,Phoebe,Really?!
968,101,0,Ross,Cassie?!
969,101,1,Cassie,Hey Ross!
970,101,2,Ross,Hey!
971,101,3,Cassie,"It?s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see"
972,101,4,Ross,"Oh. Oh, that?s right. So-so you did see me that day, because it seemed like you didn?t."
973,101,5,Tag,I?m ready for more.
974,101,6,Rachel,Tag
975,101,7,Tag,"Come on Rach, let?s give it another try."
976,101,8,Rachel,I?m having a baby.
977,101,9,Tag,Oh.
978,101,10,Rachel,You can go.
979,101,11,Tag,Thank you.
980,102,0,Monica,"She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel."
981,102,1,Chandler,"He took my joke, he took it."
982,102,2,Monica,It?s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
983,102,3,Chandler,You know who else picked Rachel?
984,102,4,Chandler,"Ross, and you know what else Ross did?"
985,102,5,Chandler,He stole my joke.
986,102,6,Chandler,You know what?
987,102,7,Chandler,I?m going to get a joke journal.
988,102,8,Chandler,Y?know?
989,102,9,Chandler,And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
990,102,10,Monica,That?s a good idea.
991,102,11,Chandler,Yeah!
992,102,12,Monica,Do you know what?s a bad idea?
993,102,13,Chandler,Picking Rachel.
994,103,0,Celia,Talk to me.
995,103,1,Ross,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."

1007,104,3,Joey,"Pretty much, yeah."
1008,104,4,Monica,I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
1009,104,5,Joey,"Well, when it?s not right, you know it."
1010,104,6,Chandler,You okay?
1011,104,7,Joey,Yeah! Yeah. I?ll be all right.
1012,104,8,Ross,Y?know what would cheer you up?
1013,104,9,Joey,What?
1014,104,10,Ross,"I?m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come."
1015,104,11,Joey,You?re right! That did cheer me up!
1016,105,0,Monica,You can not do this.
1017,105,1,Rachel,"Do what, do what?"
1018,105,2,Monica,Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
1019,105,3,Rachel,No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
1020,105,4,Phoebe,"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
1021,105,5,Monica,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do."
1022,105,6,Rachel,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
1023,105,7,Rachel,"Okay, okay, I checked."
1024,105,8,Rachel,"We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.."
1025,105,9,Rachel,Lemon Soother.
1026,105,10,Rachel,"You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you?"

1033,106,5,Joey,"Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?"
1034,106,6,Chandler,"Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator."

1036,106,8,Joey,"Hey, you're back too!"
1037,106,9,Monica,"Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?"
1038,106,10,Joey,"Hey, how was your chef thing?"
1039,106,11,Monica,"Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food."
1040,107,0,Chandler,Well hello!
1041,107,1,Joey,Where have you been?
1042,107,2,Chandler,The doctor.
1043,107,3,Ross,Is everything okay?
1044,107,4,Chandler,"Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting."
1045,107,5,Monica,Wow! It?s like Rachel in High School.
1046,107,6,Rachel,What?!!
1047,107,7,Monica,"Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!"
1048,107,8,Chandler,"That was an obvious joke, and I didn?t think of it."
1049,107,9,Chandler,Why didn?t I think of it?
1050,107,10,Chandler,The source of all my powers.
1051,107,11,Chandler,"Oh dear God, what have I done!"
1052,108,0,Phoebe,"Oh, I thought you weren?t coming. What? Where were you?"
1053,108,1,Leslie,"Come here, come here.  Okay, don?t get mad, okay."
1054,108,2,Phoebe,"Okay, don?t give me a reason to get mad, okay"
1055,108,3,Leslie,"I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts."
1056,108,4,Phoebe,"No, look, I told you that I didn?t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway."
1057,108,5,Phoebe,"God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would?ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself."
1058,108,6,Phoebe,And if I can?t trust you then just forget it.
1059,108,7,Leslie,"No, no, I don?t want to forget it."
1060,108,8,Phoebe,Okay y'know what you have to choose.
1061,108,9,Phoebe,"All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won?t be partners."
1062,108,10,Phoebe,So what?s it gonna be?
1063,109,0,Monica,"Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven."
1064,109,1,Rachel,"Thank you.  Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"

1080,110,3,Ginger,"Oh damn, I hate that."
1081,110,4,Chandler,"Yeah, we?re gonna have to get you out of those shoes."
1082,110,5,Ginger,"Oh, don?t worry about it."
1083,110,6,Chandler,"No, really you?re gonna freeze."
1084,110,7,Ginger,"No, I?m not."
1085,110,8,Chandler,"You?re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?"
1086,110,9,Ginger,"Some day, maybe."
1087,111,0,Joey,"OK, listen I?ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright?"
1088,111,1,Joey,"It?s a show, but we?re just dancing, OK?"

1107,112,7,Stephanie,Yeah. From the top?
1108,112,8,Phoebe,"Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?"
1109,112,9,Stephanie,Ok.
1110,112,10,Phoebe,Mmmm hmmm.
1111,112,11,Phoebe,That's too much. Sorry.
1112,113,0,Rachel,Oh my God!

1114,113,2,Rachel,Oh my God!
1115,113,3,Phoebe,"Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?"
1116,113,4,Rachel,"No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night."
1117,113,5,Phoebe,"Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I?m still holding this."
1118,113,6,Rachel,"Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this."
1119,113,7,Phoebe,Right.
1120,113,8,Rachel,Okay?
1121,113,9,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?"
1122,113,10,Rachel,No. Why?
1123,113,11,Phoebe,"Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it."
1124,114,0,Chandler,Morning.
1125,114,1,Joey,"Morning, hey, you made pancakes?"
1126,114,2,Chandler,"Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."

1128,114,4,Joey,Good morning.
1129,114,5,Chandler,"Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me."
1130,114,6,Janice,"Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer."
1131,114,7,Ross,"So I told Carl, ?Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.? But of course this went in one ear and out....."
1132,114,8,Rachel,I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he?s Alan Alda.
1133,114,9,Monica,"Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?"
1134,114,10,Chandler,If I was a superhero who could fly
1135,114,11,Gunther,What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.

1147,115,10,Jessica Ashley,Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
1148,115,11,Joey,"Well, that-that-that?s it? You?re gonna, you?re gonna put it on your shelf or anything?"
1149,115,12,Chandler,Why?
1150,115,13,Mr. Geller,You stole my moves.
1151,116,0,Dr. Green,just because you?re not in love with the guy you can?t
1152,116,1,Phoebe,"Wow, you told your dad the truth."
1153,116,2,Rachel,About an hour ago.
1154,116,3,Phoebe,Wanna go see a movie?
1155,116,4,Rachel,Yes!  Bye daddy.
1156,116,5,Dr. Green,there?s gonna be a wedding!
1157,116,6,Dr. Green,That?s unacceptable Rachel!
1158,116,7,Dr. Green,What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?!
1159,116,8,Dr. Green,There are more important things in a marriage other than love!
1160,116,9,Dr. Green,constantly thinking about things!
1161,116,10,Dr. Green,You have to think about the consequences of your decision.
1162,116,11,Joey,Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!  What gives you the right to?  Go to hell!  Stupid guy on my phone.
1163,117,0,Rachel,"Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight."
1164,117,1,Rachel,"I just, it was awful."
1165,117,2,Rachel,"I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don?t want to take a break."
1166,117,3,Mark,Wow. I?m sorry. Eggroll?
1167,117,4,Monica,"Okay, so it doesn?t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?"
1168,117,5,Phoebe,No!
1169,117,6,Monica,What is it?! What about Pete?
1170,117,7,Phoebe,I don?t know!
1171,117,8,Monica,"Okay, I feel like I?m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!"
1172,117,9,Phoebe,I can?t!!
1173,117,10,Monica,"Okay, I gotta go."
1174,117,11,Phoebe,"I, but you?re so close! No!"
1175,117,12,Monica,"Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete?s computer company?"
1176,117,13,Phoebe,"Oh, just go. You?re never gonna get it!"
1177,118,0,Chandler,Hi.
1178,118,1,Monica,Hey!
1179,118,2,Chandler,Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
1180,118,3,Phoebe,"Ooh, y?know what, I think it?s time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let?s go to the balcony."
1181,118,4,Monica,What?!
1182,118,5,Phoebe,"Umm, the street. Come on, let?s go to the street. Ooh, listen, don?t go onto the balcony until after I get back."
1183,118,6,Monica,"So, did you do it?"
1184,118,7,Chandler,I-I think we have too.
1185,118,8,Kathy,Okay. Bye.
1186,118,9,Chandler,Bye.  Are you still out there?
1187,118,10,Kathy,No.
1188,119,0,Monica,I don?t believe this!
1189,119,1,Monica,"Wow, look at this refrigerator!"
1190,119,2,Monica,It?s gigantic!
1191,119,3,Monica,I mean I could live in this thing!
1192,119,4,Monica,"I?d be cold, but I?m always cold."
1193,119,5,Monica,"Oh my God, look at these spider burners!"
1194,119,6,Monica,I love spider burners.
1195,119,7,Joey,"Yeah, yeah."
1196,119,8,Joey,"He?s got a, he?s got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can?t do anything about it."
1197,119,9,Joey,Is there something you can do?
1198,119,10,Guru Saj,"Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?"
1199,120,0,Ross,Slides are almost ready.
1200,120,1,Jill,"Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!"
1201,120,2,Ross,"Uh okay, well there?s-there?s wine in the kitchen."
1202,120,3,Jill,Oh great!
1203,120,4,Ross,Hello?
1204,120,5,Ross,"O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she?s really upset we?re just talking."
1205,120,6,Rachel,"Ooh, your brother. Score!"
1206,120,7,Monica,What?s up?
1207,120,8,Ross,"Oh, I?m just over here with Ben. I thought we?d say hi."
1208,120,9,Monica,"Oh, put him on!"
1209,120,10,Ross,"Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica."
1210,120,11,Ross,"Oh, I guess he doesn?t feel like talking right now."
1211,120,12,Ross,He?s smiling though!
1212,120,13,Ross,"Okay, talk to you later."
1213,121,0,Rachel,"Oh God, I really had a good time!"
1214,121,1,Dave,"Yeah, me too.  So, I guess this is it."
1215,121,2,Rachel,"Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?"
1216,121,3,Dave,Yeah!
1217,121,4,Phoebe,I will find a selfless good deed!
1218,121,5,Phoebe,'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!

1361,133,6,Rachel,Oh God.

1381,135,6,Chandler,"Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything."
1382,135,7,Phoebe,Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
1383,135,8,Chandler,What's going on?
1384,135,9,Phoebe,"I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don?t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee?Oh no, have I said to much?"
1385,135,10,Phoebe,Well it's just something to think about.

1387,136,0,Phoebe,Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here    at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
1388,136,1,Monica,"Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag    of cats against the wall."
1389,136,2,Phoebe,"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is    not gonna overuse itself."
1390,136,3,Monica,"Ok, you have to stop playing now."
1391,136,4,Phoebe,Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
1392,136,5,Monica,"Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!"
1393,136,6,Phoebe,Get your garlic-peelers    off me!
1394,136,7,Monica,"Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm    Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. ..    Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever!"
1395,136,8,Monica,"Ok, quick    question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's    singing outside?"
1396,136,9,Phoebe,"Ok, ok, how many of you"
1397,136,10,Ross,"And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?"
1398,136,11,Charlie,I didn't do that.
1399,136,12,Ross,Me neither.
1400,137,0,Joey,"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?"
1401,137,1,Phoebe,"Oh we do, but not just yet."
1402,137,2,Joey,"Really?! Well, when?"
1403,137,3,Phoebe,"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won?t work out."
1404,137,4,Joey,Wow.
1405,137,5,Phoebe,"I know. Then, I?m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you?ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids."
1406,137,6,Joey,Great!
1407,137,7,Phoebe,But then we ditch those two and that?s when we get married.
1408,137,8,Phoebe,We?ll have Chandler?s money and Rachel?s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel?s drinking problem.
1409,137,9,Joey,"Oh-oh, what about Ross?"
1410,137,10,Phoebe,"I don?t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him."
1411,138,0,Jason,"...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life."
1412,138,1,Phoebe,"That is so great! Oh, I...  Oh my God!"
1413,138,2,Jason,Whoa!
1414,138,3,Phoebe,Oh my God!!!
1415,138,4,Jason,"Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!"
1416,138,5,Phoebe,No! No!
1417,138,6,Jason,"No, no?"
1418,138,7,Phoebe,"Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic."
1419,138,8,Phoebe,"Oh my God, here they come!"
1420,138,9,Phoebe,"Well, we gotta get out of here!"
1421,138,10,Jason,W-w-w-wait! Why?!
1422,138,11,Kate,"Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie."
1423,138,12,Joey,"Yeah, that was real."
1424,139,0,Ross,"Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw"
1425,139,1,Monica,"Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?"
1426,139,2,Rachel,What?
1427,139,3,Monica,"See, I?ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I?m only planning on doing this once."
1428,139,4,Monica,"So, uh y?know, maybe this is selfish and I?m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that."
1429,139,5,Woman,Ohh great.
1430,139,6,Ross,"Can I, can I help you with something?"
1431,139,7,Woman,"Well, I don?t know. Are you a masseur?"
1432,139,8,Ross,Yes I am.
1433,139,9,Woman,"Great!  Dad!  Thank you so much, I?ll be back to pick him up in an hour."
1434,140,0,Chandler,Come on! Why are we here?!
1435,140,1,Ross,"Okay, okay take a guess."
1436,140,2,Chandler,The hot chicks?
1437,140,3,Ross,"Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y?know-y?know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up?"
1438,140,4,Ross,My doctoral dissertation!
1439,140,5,Ross,It?s here!
1440,140,6,Ross,"Yeah, it?s right-it?s right down here!"
1441,140,7,Ross,In the biggest library in the university!
1442,140,8,Chandler,Wow that?s actually pretty cool.
1443,140,9,Supervisor,We don?t need any toner.
1444,140,10,Phoebe,"Oh okay, well I?m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.  Yeah you?re right, this is easy."
1445,140,11,Supervisor,"Okay, what was wrong with that call?"
1446,140,12,Phoebe,"Oh well, all right?um, no offense, but you were kind of rude."
1447,140,13,Supervisor,"They?re always going to tell you they don?t need toner, but that?s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script."
1448,140,14,Phoebe,Oh.
1449,140,15,Supervisor,"So, I think you?re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?"
1450,140,16,Phoebe,"No.  Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?"
1451,141,0,Joey,Hello?
1452,141,1,Ross,"Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?"
1453,141,2,Joey,No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?

1457,141,6,Joey,What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
1458,141,7,Ross,Barbados.
1459,141,8,Joey,"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!"
1460,141,9,Ross,What am I supposed to do?
1461,141,10,Ross,He's out cold!
1462,141,11,Ross,In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
1463,141,12,Joey,"Well, just wake him up!"
1464,141,13,Ross,I can't! If he realizes that
1465,141,14,Joey,Uh!

1477,142,7,Monica,"Yes, hold on."
1478,142,8,Monica,"Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account."
1479,142,9,Rachel,But I haven't used my card in weeks!
1480,142,10,Monica,That
1481,142,11,Rachel,They wanna know if I'm okay.
1482,142,12,Rachel,"Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see."
1483,142,13,Rachel,"Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee!"
1484,142,14,Rachel,And it's not even for me!
1485,142,15,Rachel,"So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?"
